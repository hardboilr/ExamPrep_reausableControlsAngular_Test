Problem adding everything to .git due to "Filename too long"-error

##Notes
Everything implemented except 

- Write a unit test that tests the service implemented in 3) 

- Write a unit test that test the controller implemented in 4 

Have tried for a long time now to find simple examples of people injecting (or whatever) factories and controller for testing, but can't grasp the syntax. Sorry...
